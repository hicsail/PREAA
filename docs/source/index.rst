PREAA Overview
==============

Project PREAA is an endeavour at the Software and Application Innovation Lab (SAIL) @ Boston University
to make development of AI based pipelines reproducable. PREAA is possible thanks to a grant from the Sloan
Foundation to explore bringing AI access to academia.

PREAA is an platform developed around open source tooling to reduce the time-to-market of AI solutions
in an academic environment. Specifically, SAIL looks to improve the workflow for building embedded chat bots,
course assistants, and content aware agentic workflows.
